Pythia CLI Tool Plugins Root Folder
-----------------------------------

The plugins found here are used to get Pythia factory providers for the CLI tool. A Pythia factory provider plugin acts as a hub entry point for all the components to be packed in a Pythia-based indexing task.

Place your own plugins in a subfolder of this folder, naming each subfolder after the DLL plugin filename.

For instance, plugin Pythia.Cli.Plugin.Standard.dll should be placed in a subfolder of this folder named Pythia.Cli.Plugin.Standard.
